Tic Tac Toe
===========

This project features a fully implemented Tic Tac Toe game, complete with a GUI system in order to play. Within this project, I have also implemeneted Robot Framework in order to test my user testing cases. This project is intended to begin researching into developing user test cases and an introductory into the Scrum agile process of completing work for a client. The project also had acceptance tests, which are fully implemented with the help of the framework performing my tests for completetion. 

The project also uses the framework to play the game automatically for each test and you can see visually how the tests are being implemented within the program. It is a simple project, given complexity through the help of the robot framework.
